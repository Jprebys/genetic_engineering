# Genetic Engineering Attribution

by Jacob Prebys

### Overview

Here I will have all of my work for the Genetic Engineering Attribution Challenge competition from DrivenData. The site gives the following motivation and overview for the competition:

> Genetic engineering attribution is the process of identifying the source of a genetically engineered piece of DNA. Reducing anonymity can encourage more responsible behavior within scientific and entrepreneurial communities, without stifling innovation. The objective of this competition is to predict the laboratory of origin for plasmid DNA sequence

### Data Acquisition

Like all DataDriven competitions, you must make an account and register for the competition before you can download the data. Once you have done that you can download the training features and training labels, both of which are ~300 MB .csv files.
